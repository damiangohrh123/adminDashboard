admin dashboard project

UPDATE
-Fun Project.
-More confident on grids layouts now.
-I only used grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns. Should have tried using grid-template-area.
-Minmax (value, value) is a very good way to make responsive and scalable objects.
-Discovered a new tool called -webkit-box. I used it to clamp words and hide the overflow.
-Overall quite an easy project.
